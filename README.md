Your task is to create an API that will allow users to rent cars.

Requirements:

- user can rent a car, update the rental date, fetch rental details, and cancel a rental
- user can create an account in the service, see his account details, modify them, and delete his account
- cars can be only rented for a user that has an account in the system

This project must work seamlessly, meaning there will be no runtime errors.

Additionally, I want to be able to run the entire service by typing in my console make server.
